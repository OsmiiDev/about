Essentially, I forgot to update my site for multiple months (again!) so I decided I might as well add a blog while I'm at it


```js
"It's very silly and has"

syntax.support();

for multiple programming languages!;
```

## Markdown
Yeah it also does markdown I guess I kinda just used npm packages and modified them to suit my needs better
